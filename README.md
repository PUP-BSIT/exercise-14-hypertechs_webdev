# HYPERTECHS™
Coding the future, one line at a time.

## Description
Welcome...back to HyperTechs! We are a vibrant collective of students at PUP Taguig with a shared passion of honing our skills in web development. We dive deep into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a mission to master the art and science of crafting captivating and functional websites. 

For this week's exercise, we've added a feature where you can now sort the comments in ascending or descending date of order— giving users a more flexible view of our contents.
